A Step-by-Step Guide to Pass Play Integrity

---
## For Newbies

- This guide changes often, so it might not always work perfectly for you. If you hit a problem, you might need to do a little extra searching online.
- Google removed the old SafetyNet checks. Now, to get Strong Integrity, you need a **valid keybox**.

## Very Important To Know

- A **valid keybox** is very hard to find. A few people might try to sell them, but most are **scammers** or they'll sell you a leaked one that Google quickly blocks. So, to get integrity now, you usually need to use **spoofing**. You can do this with `TSupport Advance`, `PIF Inject`, or **manually**. Just know that spoofing doesn't always guarantee any type of integrity. Sometimes you might get **Basic** and other times **Strong**, even with the same setup. You'll likely need to try many times until it works.

- Some people suggest changing your **Play Store** to an older version (below v46) or using a modified one. I don't recommend this. You can't know if a modded version is safe or not. If you still want to try these methods, be very careful because there are risks. For more info, you might want to check out [Yuri's Telegram channel](https://t.me/yuriiroot).

## Requirements

* Rooted device.

## Steps

### 1. Ensure Root Access

* Use **Magisk**, **KernelSU**, or another method to root your device.

### 2. Flash the Magisk Modules (In This Order)

1. `Zygisk Next`
2. `PIF Fork`
3. `Shamiko`
4. `TrickyStore`
5. `Tricky Store Addon`
6. `TSupport Advance` or `Integrity Box` (don't install them in the same time)
7. In `TSupport Advance`, the **FP updater** script will run first. If you're new to the configuration or unsure, select "yes" for all options.

### 3. Reboot your device after flashing the modules.

### 4. Hiding Magisk and Root (for Magisk users only)

- Go to `Magisk` settings.
- Click on `Hide the Magisk app`.
- Select `Configure DenyList`.
- Check `Google Play Services`and `Google Play Store`.
- In the future, check any app that requires hiding root here.

### Required if you installed TSupport Advance

- Click on **Actions**.
1. Getting fingerprint:
- Select **Fprint Updater**.
- Select **Yes** for **SpoofVendingSDK**
2. Getting keybox:
- Select **EBox Updater**.
- Let it set a **Keybox** for you.
- Select "yes" to all options if you're unsure about what you need to do.

## Configuring Tricky Store (for the Keybox)

### With Tricky Addon (Easy)

- Update the **keybox** and the **target list** using `Tricky Store Addon` in `KSUWebUI`.
- For apps, check them and click on `Save`.
- For keybox, click on the menu button next to the search bar and click on `Custom keybox`.

### Manually

- Modify `target.txt` and `keybox.xml` files in that directory:
   ```
   /data/adb/tricky_store
   ```

## PIF Manual Inject

- If you can't get at least **Basic integrity**, try the `PIF Manual Inject` module, here are the steps:
1. Install the **module**
2. In `KSUWebUI`, choose `Play Integrity Fix [INJECT]`.
3. Click on `Fetch pif.json`
4. Turn on `Spoof sdk version to Play Store`
5. You can also turn on other **spoofing** options, but you don't always have to.

## Tweaking Play Store (Credits to [Yuri](https://t.me/yuriiroot))

* Still no integrity? Try this method, and make sure to keep everything you've already done.
* There are 2 methods here: 
- Downgrading `Play Store` to something below **v46**.
- Installing `Play Store Mod`.
* You can try both of them.
